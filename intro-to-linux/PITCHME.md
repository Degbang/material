## What is Linux ?
Linux is an open source operating system (OS). 

A good start to the class would be asking the students if they know what Linux is, although they may be quiet at first, we found that the more engaging a class is, the more keen they are to learn too.

* What are other famous open source operating systems?
* What is an operating system?
* Do they use an OS?


Every Linux-based OS involves the Linux kernel.

THat's the main component of the Linux operating system, communicates between a computer's hardware and its processes.

A nice analogy to explain the role of the kernel:


```
The kernel is a busy personal assistant for a powerful executive (the hardware).

It’s the assistant’s job to relay messages and requests (processes) from employees and the public (users) to the executive, to remember what is stored where (memory), and to determine who has access to the executive at any given time and for how long.
```


## Linux and Open source
Anyone can run, study and modify and redistribute the Linux source code.


## Linux Distributions

Linux distribution = complete Linux system package

Different distros can be customized for specific user gorups, for example software enginners or audio/video editors

## Command Line
The command line is your direct access to a computer.

It's like a text interface to your computer.

The command line and open source software, together, give users unrestricted access to their computer.

* Do any students use the command line?
* How else do we refer to it? Hint: terminal, shell, console
