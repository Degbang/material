## Tuple
A way to join related data:
```python
hostport = ("accdev1", 3213)
```
Tuple is immutable unlike python list 

+++
## Tuple
Data elements don't have names
```python
sam = ("Sam Moorhouse", 1984)
```
* What does *1984* refer to? (Careful!)
* Is there a better way?

## Tuple creation and deconstruction
```
a = ("MNNIT Allahabad", 5000, "Engineering") 
(college, student, type_ofcollege) = a 
 
# print college name
print(college)
 
# print no of student
print(student)
 
# print type of college
print(type_ofcollege)
```
